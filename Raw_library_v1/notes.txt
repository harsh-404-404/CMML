Gaussian Elimination

some basic oparations on matrices:
    1.interchanging two rows changes the sign of the determinant
    2.multiplying a row by a scalar multiplies the determinant by that scalar
    3.addition of a multiple of one row to another row does not change the determinant (IMP).
    4.determinant of triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.

Gaussian Elimination:
    1.reduce the matrix to an upper triangular form using row operations.
    2.the determinant is the product of the diagonal elements, multiplied by any scalars used in row operations.

How to make any matrix in to a upper triangular matrix:
    (https://www.youtube.com/live/rrWm9W87wcI?app=desktop&t=127s)<-- source
    1.start with the first row and use it to eliminate all entries below the leading entry (pivot) in that column.
    2.move to the next row and repeat the process for the submatrix that excludes the rows and columns already processed.
    3.continue this process until the entire matrix is in upper triangular form.

    Note:- if pivot element is zero, we may need to interchange rows to get a non-zero pivot.
            rule 1:- you can only interchange row only row below the current row.

    how to element the entries:
        Rx - x*Rp (where Rx is the row to be eliminated, Rp is the pivot row, and x is the factor to eliminate the entry).

        x = entry/pivot




There is a famous mathematical algorithm called the Box-Muller Transform. It turns "Flat Randomness" (Uniform) into "Bell Curve Randomness" (Gaussian).
The Equations:Given two random numbers U1 and U2, uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 1], the Box-Muller transform produces two independent standard normally distributed random numbers Z0 and Z1 using the following equations:
Z0 = sqrt(-2 * ln(U1)) * cos(2 * π * U2)
Z1 = sqrt(-2 * ln(U1)) * sin(2 * π * U2)

//    random float between x and y
    int x=11;

The adjoint of a matrix is the transpose of its cofactor matrix
